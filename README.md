# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview 

The purpose of this project is to compare the total weekly fares of each city type for the ride-share company, PyBer. This information will help to determine where resources should be allocated to drive more business.

This analysis was completed by grouping the fare totals of each of the three city types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. Then a chart was created using this data, displayed per week between January through April.

##Results

From the chart, it can be determined that the Urban fares, yellow, generate the most revenue, followed by Suburban, red, and Rural, blue, generates the least amount of revenue between Jan and April.

The PyBer summary analysis determined that, as the table shows, Urban cities generate the highest dollars in fares overall, then Suburban, then Rural. However, the average fare is the opposite, with Rural having the highest dollar fares per driver and per ride, followed by Suburban, then Urban. This is likely because of two factors, Rural fares would likely have a longer duration than Urban ones, and drivers would earn more since there is less competition in these areas. 

##Summary

There are less total Rural and Suburban drivers than total rides given, while the opposite can be said of the Urban citites where there are nearly 1.5 times as many drivers to rides given. With the Rural and Suburban markets less saturated, the drivers make more money, but the company could be missing opportunies with such a limited number of drivers. If more resources were given the Suburban and Rural markets to gain more drivers, the total fares would likely increase, generating more cash for the company.
